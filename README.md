# Internship_Project
Project is a Windows Forms application for creating and viewing submissions, with fields for name, email, phone number, and GitHub link. It connects to a backend Express server built with TypeScript, storing data in a JSON file and providing endpoints for CRUD operations. The form includes a stopwatch to track the time taken for each submission.
